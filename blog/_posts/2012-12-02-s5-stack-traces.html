<p>

We've started using <a
href="http://brownplt.github.com/2011/11/11/s5-javascript-semantics.html">S5</a>
to learn about some multi-thousand line programs.  While debugging some
of the problems S5 had with these, it was clear that we needed some
better error messages coming out of the interpreter.  This stands to
reason: as our codebase grows up to tackle more complicated use cases,
the tools need to scale up as well.

</p>

<p>

Sometimes, we'd run into a bug in the environment, and other times a desugaring
bug would trigger an error thrown from the environment.  Our environment is 5000
lines of S5 code, each of which may be invoked by desugared code. For example,
we have a <a href="https://github.com/brownplt/LambdaS5/blob/ce962c817783164f3ad
94770d0e32d023e239b43/envs/es5.env#L947">function</a> that checks if a value is
actually an object, used before property lookup and at the top of built-ins such
as <code>Object.getPrototypeOf()</code> and
<code>Object.defineProperty()</code>.

</p>

<p>

This abstraction is great: it makes desugared code read cleaner (much better
than if it were inlined), and shares the functionality across many contexts.
Sadly, when the <code>TypeError</code> was thrown, S5 only knew that it came
from that particular line in the environment.  That isn't particularly useful
when that line was reached from line 2398 in a 10000 line file.  We needed
stack traces.  Today we're going to walk through the process of adding stack
traces to S5.  The total change came in at a whopping 77 lines of code, split
across <a href="https://github.com/brownplt/LambdaS5/commit/110d5b5146b05144b78ec88bd7dd883a014e5769">two</a> <a

<p>

We already keep track of the source position (in the original source file) of
every expression we create in desugaring: our expression type has a special spot
for it:

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">type</span> <span class="n">exp</span> <span class="o">=</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Null</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">pos</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Undefined</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">pos</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">pos</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="kt">string</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Num</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">pos</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="kt">float</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">True</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">pos</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">False</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">pos</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Id</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">pos</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">id</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Object</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">pos</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">attrs</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">string</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">prop</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="kt">list</span>
  <span class="o">...</span>
</pre>
</div>

</p>

<p>

We just need to find a way to get the information about the expressions we've
visited out to the toplevel, and then to the user.  S5 models JavaScript
exceptions with a special <em>Ocaml</em> exception type:

</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">exception</span> <span class="nc">Throw</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">store</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>

This construct keeps track of the value that's propagating upward, and can be
recognized by an Ocaml catch block in the implementation of S5
<code>try</code>; the <code>store</code> is included because the interpreter
itself is implemented in pure store-passing style (thanks to Ben Lerner). What
<code>Throw</code> is lacking is any sort of context about where the exception
came from.  But this is easy to add:

</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">exception</span> <span class="nc">Throw</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">exp</span> <span class="kt">list</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">store</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>

Now a <code>Throw</code> can keep track of an entire list of expressions, for
example, the list of expressions in the context of its evaluation.  To get the
chain started: we create a single element list when an actual <code>throw</code>
occurs.  This is straightforward to locate in the interpreter.  This:

</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">match</span> <span class="n">exp</span> <span class="k">with</span>
  <span class="o">...</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nn">Syntax</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">Throw</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">let</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">eval</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="n">env</span> <span class="n">store</span> <span class="k">in</span>
    <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Throw</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="o">))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Becomes:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">match</span> <span class="n">exp</span> <span class="k">with</span>
  <span class="o">...</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nn">Syntax</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">Throw</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">let</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">eval</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="n">env</span> <span class="n">store</span> <span class="k">in</span>
    <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Throw</span> <span class="o">([</span><span class="n">exp</span><span class="o">],</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="o">))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>

This on its own will only include the throw expression itself.  But, there's no
reason we need to let this Ocaml <code>raise</code> statement reach all the way
to the surrounding <code>try</code> or the toplevel.  We can wrap <em>every</em>
expression evaluation in a handler for the <code>Throw</code> special exception.
The handler adds the current expression to the list, and reraises the exception:

</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">rec</span> <span class="n">eval</span> <span class="n">exp</span> <span class="n">env</span> <span class="n">store</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">store</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">=</span>
  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">eval</span> <span class="n">exp</span> <span class="n">env</span> <span class="n">store</span> <span class="o">=</span>
    <span class="k">begin</span> <span class="k">try</span> <span class="n">eval</span> <span class="n">exp</span> <span class="n">env</span> <span class="n">store</span>
      <span class="k">with</span> 
      <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Throw</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">exprs</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Throw</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">exp</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">exprs</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="o">))</span>
    <span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">in</span>
  <span class="k">match</span> <span class="n">exp</span> <span class="k">with</span>
  <span class="o">...</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nn">Syntax</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">Throw</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">...</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nn">Syntax</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">Object</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">attrs</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">props</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">...</span>
  <span class="o">...</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>

Now, all inner calls to the evaluator will be wrapped in a handler that is
patiently waiting for the possibility of a thrown exception, to add the current
expression and continue up the chain.  We try it out, and get some crazy looking
output:

</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>../envs/es5.env:6:0-0

Fatal error: exception Failure<span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Uncaught exception&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>

All told, there are around 1000 lines of output. That is, the interpreter was
1000 expressions deep when some exception was thrown on line 1981 of
<code>mybigfile</code> (the error itself is irrelevent here, the fact is that
it happened and we needed to diagnose it).  But a lot of this is just noise: The
first 574 lines are simply the environment warming up, and would be at the front
of any such stack trace.  All the lines that print as <code>":0:-1--1"</code>
are dummy positions inserted by desugaring for intermediate expressions that
don't have any corresponding source location.

</p>

<p>

There's no reason we have to print the whole stack trace, though.  It's just a
list of expressions that we're printing the positions of, and we can write
arbitrary filters over it.  That's just what we did: wrote one filter to remove
leading entries with the same file name, and another to remove all dummy
positions.  After doing that, we get much more reasonable output:

</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>../envs/es5.env:6:0-0
tests/mybigfile.js:355:-11--9
tests/mybigfile.js:355:-11--9

Fatal error: exception Failure<span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Uncaught exception&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>

We might decide later that we want these to look like traditional stack traces,
and only print at function boundaries.  But we might also be interested in
writing other predicates over the expressions we're deep inside when an error
occurs.  Perhaps we'll want to detect changes across file boundaries, or
exceptions that flow through specific files in the environment.  Simple
additions like this are possible because our interpreter is small and
traditional; these small changes gave us an enormous boost in error
understanding.  S5 is a fertile ground for trying out ideas like these on an
interpreter that handles a real language.  What do you want to build?
