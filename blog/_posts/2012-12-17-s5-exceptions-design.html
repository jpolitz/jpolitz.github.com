<p> During our development of <a
href="http://brownplt.github.com/2011/11/11/s5-javascript-semantics.html">S5</a>
(start there if you have no idea what S5 is, as this post assumes some
background), our implementation hit several pain points.  These are
useful points in the specification to highlight, because our
implementation is designed to give an unambiguous, precise,
understandable account of the language that we can use to make formal
claims.</p>

<p>This post touches on one such pain point, which is balancing the
creation of exceptions objects between the core semantics and the
desugaring to the core.  This split highlights some of the invariants we
try to maintain in our core language, and where they are broken by the
specification.  I don't think this is pointing out any flaw in either;
rather, it's an example of a case where traditional models for semantics
face difficulty with real-world language features.  There is a real
design tradeoff here, and S5 currently sits somewhere in the middle
between two ends of the spectrum.</p>

<h3>Implicit Creation of Exceptions Objects</h3>

<p><a href="http://es5.github.com/#x10.2.1.2.4">Several</a>
<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x10.5">points</a>
<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x11.2.2">in the</a>
<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x11.2.3">spec</a> mandate throwing an
exception of a particular class.
</p>

<p>As with any feature in the specification, we have two choices for how
to handle these exceptions.  We can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make them a part of the semantics, or</li>
  <li>Desugar them away into existing parts of the semantics.</li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases, this is straightforward.  For example, when
<code>defineOwnProperty</code> is called and tries to change a property
from non-writable to writable on a non-<code>configurable</code> field,
an exception object needs to be created with the built-in
<code>TypeError</code> as its internal <code>proto</code> field.  </p>

<p>In this case, we use different exceptions we've defined in a <a
href="https://github.com/brownplt/LambdaS5/blob/master/envs/es5.env#L55">core
semantics implementation</a>, and provide an <a
href="https://github.com/brownplt/LambdaS5/blob/master/envs/es5.env#L653">implementation of
<code>defineOwnProperty</code></a> in the core that instantiates the correct
kind of exception.  The same pattern is used in a number of built-in
functions, and is straightforward and uncontroversial.</p>

<h3>Even More Implicit Creations</h3>

<p>This works just fine for a number of cases, especially built-in
functions.  Others cause some head-scratching.  For example, setting an
unwritable field also throws a <code>TypeError</code>.  The semantics is
aware of the writability of fields, and will thus refuse to perform
assignment on one.  But the semantics still isn't, and I argue
<em>shouldn't</em>, be in charge of allocating a new exception object
and knowing about <code>TypeError</code>s.  There are at least two
reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>

  <p> We have kept the creation of objects to a minimum in our core
semantics.  Only object literal expressions and object key extraction
expressions are capable of adding new locations on the heap for objects.
All other creations of objects in the spec are desugared into these two
operations.  This aids proofs over the core, because more of the
operations in the semantics enjoy the invariant that they cannot change
the object store in any way.  </p>

</li>

<li>

  <p>The core semantics and interpreter start evaluation with an empty
heap that contains no objects, and an empty environment that contains no
bindings.  This isn't what I'd recommend for a blazingly <em>fast</em>
implementation of JavaScript, but it is a clean model: because of (1),
this means that all object references come from some allocation in the
code. Expecting that something named <code>TypeError</code> would be
available at the level of the semantics time would require violating
this property, and would complicate the clean model of evaluation.

</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p>
So, it seems like the natural thing to do for assignment to unwritable
fields is to desugar field assignment to check for writability and throw
the correct exception if the field isn't writable.  That is, we would
transform:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
o[x] = 5

// becomes

if (o[x<#writable>]) o[x] = 5
else %TypeError("unwritable field")
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This works correctly, though the actual implementation would be a bit
longer, because it would also need to check for extensibility.  There
are two drawbacks, however:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>

The desugared code is <em>much</em> less readable, because a field
assignment at the surface is nearly unrecognizable (imagine what a
nested assignment like <code>o[x] = o[y] = 4</code>).

</p></li>

<li><p>

From an engineering point of view, we now have the desugared code
checking for writability, <em>and</em> the interpreter
<a href="https://github.com/brownplt/LambdaS5/blob/master/src/ljs/ljs_eval.ml#L280">
checking for it</a>, with presumably, but not actually guaranteed, dead
code in the exception case.

</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>One Alternate Approach</h3>

<p>

We've started experimenting with another appraoch as a result of being
somewhat dissatisfied with the pure desugaring approach above.  We let
the interpreter's checks happen, and have the interpreter throw
exceptions as primitive values that can be caught by the desugared code.
Our desugaring becomes:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
o[x] = 5

// becomes

try { o[x] = 5 } catch %ErrorDispatch
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
This is less desugared cruft than before, and relies on two tricks for
defining <code>%ErrorDispatch</code> and tidying up the interaction with
the rest of desugaring.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>

We embed all user-thrown values one level deep in an object data
structure with a tagged field that lets us tell user-thrown values
from interpreter-thrown exceptions.  If we didn't do this, actual
JavaScript code might be able to act like the trusted interpreter.  We
do this in the <a
href="https://github.com/brownplt/LambdaS5/blob/master/src/exprjs/exprjs_to_ljs.ml#L359">desugaring
of throw expressions</a>.

</p></li>

<li><p>

The catch block, <code>%ErrorDispatch</code>, checks the thrown value to
see if it is a user-thrown or interpreter-thrown exception.  It passes
on user-thrown exceptions, and converts interpreter-thrown exceptions to
the appropriate type.  For example, in this case, it <a
href="https://github.com/brownplt/LambdaS5/blob/master/envs/es5.env#L110">recognizes
the string <code>"unwritable field"</code> and creates a
<code>TypeError</code></a>.

</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Tradeoffs</h3>

<p>

There are pros and cons to this pattern.

</p>

<p>

It moves the desugaring burden from the checks around uses of built-in
forms to the definition of <code>%ErrorDispatch</code>, which makes
desugared code clearer.  It also maintains all the invariants we want
about the interpreter itself.  On the other hand, it adds an extra
implicit dependency between the strings used in the interpreter.  It
also makes the desugared code less explicit in exchange for removing
some noise.  We'll see how well we like this, and if certain classes of
exceptions should use different strategies.  Function application and
lookup on <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> could also use
this treatment to clarify desugared code, but it's probably not worth it
for built-in functions.
