<h3>Scoring in Go</h3>

<em>Disclaimer:  I am not a Go expert.  I haven't done much research on
the topic I'm writing about, so my intent really is to build this up
from my intuitions about the game.  I'd be happy to hear if these
definitions have already been written down by someone somewhere
else.</em>

<p>

Go is a complicated game.  It’s so complicated that determining who has
won is a nontrivial task.
Scores in games played by humans are arrived at by consensus and seldom
seem controversial, but the complex cases can be quite puzzling.  The
problem is hard for computers, too.
  <a
href="http://www.online-go.com/faq.php?name=rules">Simplified
versions</a> of both so-called Japanese and Chinese rules are used by
online Go services, and the OGS even has a disclaimer:

<blockquote> Some sekis contain false eyes that cannot be removed - this
count as points in Chinese rules but not in Japanese rules. OGS
implements a complex algorithm to detects those situation (sic). Since
it’s quite tricky situation to detects, the scoring algorithm might have
some flaw and wrongly detects false eyes. If this happens in one of your
games please raise a support ticket and we will get the game resolved.
</blockquote>

To me, this quote sounds an awful lot like amateur attempts at sound
program analyses and type-checking.  “We wrote something that’s really
hard and complicated; if you find something that it lets happen that you
don’t like, that’s a bug and you should let us know.”  But there’s no
actual truth to compare against other than a sequence of
counterexamples.  That is, it’s not clear if we could prove the
algorithm correct, or if a correct but inefficient version exists.

</p>

<p>

I think it’s fascinating that there isn’t a canonical algorithm for
determining the score of a Go game, or even if the game is finished.
While I can’t hope to settle scoring for all of Go in a single post,
it’s a fun exercise to see what happens if we try to develop
<em>one</em> unambiguous definition of scoring for Go.  Note that coming
up with such a definition isn't likely to change the outcome of any Go
tournaments, past or future.  It's simply an attempt to make
well-defined an arcane part of the game that is based on experience,
history, and best practice.

</p>

<h3>Go’s “Simple” Rules</h3>

<p>

Everyone who has taught me Go has touted the simplicity and elegance of
the rules.  I've passed this sentiment on to those I've taught, but in
reality the rules are anything but.  Go games most closely resemble
something like cellular automata à la the Game of Life: local
relationships decide whether stones remain on the board or leave, and
small differences in nearby board states can result in vastly different
global outcomes.  If existing similar models are any indication, this
should lead to complex traces through the game indeed.

</p>

<p>

I'm going to introduce the rules of Go with a special eye towards what
can get complicated.  As always, we play on the vertices of the board
(whose size is fixed in a given game, but may vary depending on the
desired length and complexity of the game), using black and white
pieces.  Players can play on most of the vertices most of the time.  In
the beginning of the game, there are no restrictions.  Play might
proceed like this:

<div>
<canvas id='firstExample1' width=200 height=200></canvas>
<canvas id='firstExample2' width=200 height=200></canvas>
<canvas id='firstExample3' width=200 height=200></canvas>
</div>
<div>
<canvas id='firstExample4' width=200 height=200></canvas>
<canvas id='firstExample5' width=200 height=200></canvas>
<canvas id='firstExample6' width=200 height=200></canvas>
<script>
drawBoardAt('firstExample1', [[K,K,K],
                              [B,K,K],
                              [K,K,K]]);
drawBoardAt('firstExample2', [[K,K,K],
                              [B,W,K],
                              [K,K,K]]);
drawBoardAt('firstExample3', [[K,B,K],
                              [B,W,K],
                              [K,K,K]]);
drawBoardAt('firstExample4', [[K,B,K],
                              [B,W,K],
                              [W,K,K]]);
drawBoardAt('firstExample5', [[K,B,K],
                              [B,W,K],
                              [W,B,K]]);
drawBoardAt('firstExample6', [[W,B,K],
                              [B,W,K],
                              [W,B,K]]);
</script>

</div>

So far, not much exciting has happened; merely alternating turns and
playing stones.  We can get our first excitement if black plays to
completely surround the center white stone:

</p>

<div>
<canvas id='firstExample7' width=200 height=200></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('firstExample7', [[W,B,K],
                              [B,W,B],
                              [W,B,K]]);
</script>

<p>

This is usually the first rule taught: a completely stone is
<em>captured</em> when there are no empty spaces around it.  So the
center white stone would be removed:
</p>

<div>
<canvas id='firstExample8' width=200 height=200></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('firstExample8', [[W,B,K],
                              [B,K,B],
                              [W,B,K]]);
</script>

<p>Depending on the scoring system being used, this might award points
to the black player.  For our purposes, it’s enough to keep track of the
fact that a stone was captured, and we'll use the information later if
we need to.
</p>

<p>
We also now have our first interesting <em>constraint</em> on the moves
white can make next.  White <em>is not</em> allowed to play into the
empty space in the center in a valiant attempt to commit suicide.
From white’s point of view, the board looks more like:
</p>

<div>
<canvas id='firstExample9' width=200 height=200></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('firstExample9', [[W,B,K],
                              [B,M,B],
                              [W,B,K]]);
</script>

<p>Constraints like this are useful because they tell us what the board
might have to look like for white to have <em>no</em> allowed moves,
which would suggest some sort of end state for the game.</p>

<h4>Groups</h4>

<p>That first example was a simple capture of a single stone.  Stones
that touch form groups and live or die together.  So if the board looked
like:</p>

<div>
<canvas id='groups1' width=200 height=200></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('groups1', [[W,B,B,K],
                        [B,W,W,K],
                        [W,B,B,K]]);
</script>

<p>Then black could capture <em>both</em> center white stones:</p>

<div>
<canvas id='groups2' width=300 height=200></canvas>
<canvas id='groups3' width=200 height=200></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('groups2', [[W,B,B,K],
                        [B,W,W,B],
                        [W,B,B,K]]);
drawBoardAt('groups3', [[W,B,B,K],
                        [B,K,K,B],
                        [W,B,B,K]]);
</script>

<p>As far as constraints on the next play go, white it isn't suicide for
white to play in the spots that were just taken, so playing there is
allowed (though not necessarily strategic):</p>

<div>
<canvas id='groups4' width=300 height=200></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('groups4', [[W,B,B,K],
                        [B,W,K,B],
                        [W,B,B,K]]);
</script>

<p>But on future moves, white has restricted itself, as moving again in
the inner space would be suicide:</p>

<div>
<canvas id='groups5' width=300 height=200></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('groups5', [[W,B,B,K],
                        [B,W,M,B],
                        [W,B,B,K]]);
</script>

<p>Note that white is <em>definitionally</em> not allowed to move in
this space; it isn't just poor play.</p>

<h4>From the Jaws</h4>

<p>The moves we've been calling “suicide” moves so far are more subtle
than the examples have covered.  This is because, in another twist,
if playing a move would capture opposing stones, those stones are
removed before suicide is checked for.  This means that some apparently
suicidal moves are in fact fine.  Below, white <em>can</em> play at the
green mark, even though it is completely surrounded by black stones:</p>

<div>
<canvas id='suicide1' width=300 height=200></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('suicide1', [[K,W,W,B,K],
                         [W,B,B,G,B],
                         [K,W,W,B,K]]);
</script>

<p>After, the board would look like:</p>

<div>
<canvas id='suicide2' width=300 height=200></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('suicide2', [[K,W,W,B,K],
                         [W,K,K,W,B],
                         [K,W,W,B,K]]);
</script>

<p>All of the examples to do with captures so far can be summed up in an
algorithm for a given stone placement:

<ol>
<li>
Place a stone on any unoccupied space.
</li>
<li>
Check if any opposing groups are completely surrounded.  If so,
remove them and mark them as captured.
</li>
<li>
Check if any friendly groups are completely surrounded.  If so,
the move is <em>invalid</em>.
</li>
</ol>

This is straightforward, but the order is quite important.</p>

<h4>Infinities</h4>

<p>
The last real rule we need to decide on has to do with repeated board
states.  Since we can both add and remove stones to the board over the
course of the game, and old captured spaces become valid places to play
once the old stones are removed, it isn't obvious that a Go game would
have to finish.  Consider this board, where black can take a white stone
by playing at the green mark:
</p>

<div>
<canvas id='ko1' width=300 height=200></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('ko1', [[K,W,B,K],
                    [W,G,W,B],
                    [K,W,B,K]]);
</script>

<p>The resulting board gives white the same option...</p>

<div>
<canvas id='ko2' width=300 height=200></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('ko2', [[K,W,B,K],
                    [W,B,G,B],
                    [K,W,B,K]]);
</script>

<p>Which would bring us back to the same on-board state as before:</p>

<div>
<canvas id='ko3' width=300 height=200></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('ko3', [[K,W,B,K],
                    [W,G,W,B],
                    [K,W,B,K]]);
</script>

<p>It’s useful to rule out such infinite loops for a definition of game
termination and scoring.  (It’s not imperative; we might be able to show
that it’s never strategically advantageous for both players to engage in
an infinite loop, so we don't need to worry about them for scoring since
we only score games in which players are trying to win.  But for a
starting definition, it’s useful to know that all games actually end.)
We are going to take a hard line on such “ko” states, and say that
<em>no on-board state is allowed to repeat</em> (this is hard to keep
track of in real games, so the rule is usually that black would have to
make some other move before returning to capture the white stone).  We
can update our turn-by-turn algorithm to reflect this:</p>

<ol>
<li>
Place a stone on any unoccupied space.
</li>
<li>
Check if any opposing groups are completely surrounded.  If so,
remove them and mark them as captured.
</li>
<li>
Check if any friendly groups are completely surrounded.  If so,
the move is <em>invalid</em>.
</li>
<li>
Check if the current board state is in the history of states for this
game.  If so, the move is <em>invalid</em>.
</li>
<li>
If the current board state is valid, add it to the history of states.
</li>
</ol>

<p>

This definition of a turn has some nice properties.  The best is that we
can say that any Go game played with these rules must terminate!  It's
obvious that there are a finite number of on-board states (a mere
3<sup>b<sup>2</sup></sup>), where <em>b</em> is the width of the board.
Every valid move visits a new board state (by step 4, this must be
true), so play marches towards a state where no valid moves are left for
either player.  We can safely call this state an end state of the game.

</p>

<p>In the rules so far, we've assumed that both players play every turn.
This doesn't necessarily seem fair.  Consider this game, where we show
the whole board nearly full:</p>


<div>
<canvas id='full1' width=500 height=300></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('full1', [[M,W,B,B,B],
                      [W,M,W,B,G],
                      [W,W,W,B,B],
                      [W,W,W,B,G],
                      [W,W,W,B,B]],
            {full: true});
</script>

<p>Black cannot play in the two red spots because it would be suicide.
Similarly, white cannot play in the green spots.  But if black plays in
either of the two green spots (the only ones allowed), suddenly white
can capture rather than suicide at the other, and can take all of
black's stones:</p>

<div>
<canvas id='full2' width=300 height=300></canvas>
<canvas id='full3' width=300 height=300></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('full2', [[G,W,B,B,B],
                      [W,G,W,B,B],
                      [W,W,W,B,B],
                      [W,W,W,B,G],
                      [W,W,W,B,B]],
            {full: true});
drawBoardAt('full3', [[K,W,K,K,K],
                      [W,K,W,K,K],
                      [W,W,W,K,K],
                      [W,W,W,K,W],
                      [W,W,W,K,K]],
            {full: true});
</script>

<p>The situation would be similarly bad for white if it were white's
turn.  Thus, this situation is a game of chicken between the players,
and whoever is first loses.  Both players have built up a strong
position with two holes in their group, making them uncapturable unless
they sabatoge themselves.  To avoid this forced self-sabatoge, the rules
allow players to <em>pass</em> the turn rather than play (there is at
least one interesting variation here: whether players can pass one turn
at a time and still play on subsequent turns, or if they give up their
ability to play for the rest of the game, effectively declaring
themselves done).  In this situation, both black and white would elect
to pass indefinitely.  For our purposes, we'll clearly lay out the rules
of ending the game around our per-turn algorithm above to reflect this
case.</p>

<ol>
<li>
  Black plays or passes.  If all moves are <em>invalid</em> for black,
  black passes by default.
</li>
<li>
  If white passed last turn and black passes, the game is over.
  Otherwise, continue.
</li>
<li>
  White plays or passes.  If all moves are <em>invalid</em> for white,
  white passes by default.
</li>
<li>
  If both players passed this turn, the game is over.  Otherwise, return
  to 1.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Both players passing is the usual ending condition for Go; I'm not
aware of any non-tutorial Go game ever that led to only invalid moves
for both players with the definition above.  What happens after both
players pass is the actual scoring to decide who wins.</p>

<h4>The Scoring</h4>

<p>I'm going to build up a definition of scoring here that isn’t quite
how Go is scored in tournaments.  In a brief discussion after, I will
argue that the tournament scoring methods are (potentially quite
accurate) approximations of this scoring system.  That is, all those
folks in tournaments are really just saving themselves time and not
going into all this pedantic nonsense that I'm spouting here.  But, my
definition will be rigorous and precise, avoiding any need to speculate
on what would happen if you “just played it out,” so onward
we go.</p>

<p>There are several pieces of information we can use to assign a score
after both players have passed:</p>

<ul>
<li>The stones on the board</li>
<li>The stones captured</li>
<li>The empty spaces on the board</li>
<li>The game history</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m going to throw out the game history from consideration for
calculating scores.  There's probably something frightfully complicated
that can be done with the history to judge how players do, but in the
interest of simplicity, I’ll focus on the board and the captures.</p>

<p>It’s worth taking a minute to think about what would make a
definition of scoring both useful and appropriate.  I’ll assume that
it’s uncontroversial that the goal of the game is to have some sort of
<em>control</em> over the board, and this should be reflected in the
score, for some definition of <em>control</em>.</p>

<p>Let's think about what control might mean in terms of the end board
state, and in terms of captures that may have happened along the way.
Each player has an equal number of opportunities to play stones.  If no
captures happen, the player who passes least will have more stones on
the board.  I’ll take the position that passing represents some sort of
weakness; the lack of the ability to make a move means the passing
player has less <em>control</em> over the board.  The corollary is that
having more stones on the board at the end of the game results in a
higher score.  So in this game, white wins, since it played more stones
and no captures happened (note that black probably passed a number of
times at the end of the game to avoid endangering its large group):
</p>

<div>
<p><em>White captures: 0, Black captures: 0</em></p>
<p><em>White stones: 13, Black stones: 8</em></p>
<canvas id='score1' width=500 height=300></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('score1', [[K,W,W,B,B],
                       [W,K,W,B,K],
                       [W,W,W,B,B],
                       [W,W,W,B,K],
                       [W,W,W,B,B]],
            {full: true});
</script>

<p>Things get interesting when we consider captures.  When stones are
captured, new space opens up on the board to play in.  All other things
being equal (e.g. with no further captures or extra passes from one
player), both players should be able to fill up about half the space.
In practice, since the captured area is (by necessity) already
surrounded, it’s usually easier for the capturer to take advantage of
the space than the capturee.  So, even if we don't count the captures at
the end of the game, their effect should be visible in the counts of
stones on the board.  But if we don't count captures, we can end up with
bizarre results.  Who should win the following game:</p>


<div>
<p><em>Black passes 24 times in succession, white plays 24 stones</em></p>
<canvas id='score2' width=500 height=300></canvas>
<p><em>Black astutely captures 24 stones...</em></p>
<canvas id='score3' width=500 height=300></canvas>
<p><em>Play continues and both players finally pass at:</em></p>
<canvas id='score4' width=500 height=300></canvas>
</div>
<script>
drawBoardAt('score2', [[W,W,W,W,W],
                       [W,K,W,W,W],
                       [W,W,W,W,W],
                       [W,W,W,W,W],
                       [W,W,W,W,W]],
            {full: true});
drawBoardAt('score3', [[K,K,K,K,K],
                       [K,B,K,K,K],
                       [K,K,K,K,K],
                       [K,K,K,K,K],
                       [K,K,K,K,K]],
            {full: true});
drawBoardAt('score4', [[B,K,B,W,W],
                       [K,B,B,W,W],

                       [W,W,W,K,W],
                       [W,W,W,K,K]],
            {full: true});
</script>
