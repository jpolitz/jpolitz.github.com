<em>This post was inspired by a <a
href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4985853">recent thread</a> on
Hacker News that created some conversation about the this keyword in
JavaScript.  I want to thank Henry for writing that post and laying out
the base cases that I built on for this post.</em>

<p>JavaScript has some confusing features.  Every now and then, I see
blog posts detailing “how to understand closures in JavaScript” or
“grokking closures in JavaScript.”  Most of these are written, quite
appropriately, by folks who are learning about JavaScript's features and
sharing their knowledge as they learn useful tricks and build up an
understanding of the language.  As a result, these posts are often
incomplete.  Now, you can go to the <a
href="http://es5.github.com">JavaScript spec</a> if you want a more
detailed answer to your question, but the spec isn't nicely laid out as
"here are all the ways <code>this</code> could be bound" and "here's how
variable binding (doesn't) work in JavaScript."</p>

<p>I wish there was a resource that laid out features this way, so I'm
going to try writing down a few lists of what I think are comprehensive
descriptions of some features of JavaScript.  I'll happily update the
post (with credit) when folks find stuff that I forgot to add to the
list.  I'll try to order things so that corner-case uses come later in
the list than the most frequent uses, but there will be some random
judgment calls made by me in there.  Without further ado...</p>

<h3>Binding <code>this</code></h3>

<p>There are lots of ways to get the keyword <code>this</code> bound in
JavaScript.</p>

<h4>Method Invocation</h4>

<p>
In a method invocation expression, the result of evaluating the
expression to the left of the dot or bracket will be bound as
<code>this</code> inside the called method:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
o = { x:22, fun: function() { return this.x; } };
o.fun(); // returns 22
o.["f" + "un"](); // returns 22

function return_o() { return o; }
return_o().fun(); // returns 22
{% endhighlight %}

<h4>Function Invocation</h4>

<p>If you call a method with function call syntax, even if it used to be
a field of an object, one of two things will happen:

<ul>

<li>The common case is that it will have <code>window</code> passed to
it as <code>this</code> (it's actually just "the global object," which
is a different thing if you're on the server running Node, but the
common case is <code>window</code> in the browser).

{% highlight javascript %}
window.x = 42;
o = { x:22, fun: function() { return this.x; } }
extracted = o.fun;
extracted(); // returns 42, not 22
{% endhighlight %}
</li>

<li> If the target function is in <a
href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/12/14/strict-mode-is-coming-to-town/"><em>strict
mode</em></a> (which you should start using immediately if you aren't),
in which case <code>undefined</code> will be bound to
<code>this</code> (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x10.4.3">the "set to
global" option is skipped</a>):

{% highlight javascript %}
window.x = 42;
o = { x:22, fun: function() { "use strict"; return typeof this; } }
extracted = o.fun;
extracted(); // returns "undefined"
{% endhighlight %}

</li>
</ul>

<h4>Callbacks To ECMAScript Builtins</h4>

<p> When you pass callbacks to built-in ECMAScript functions like
<code>forEach</code>, you can supply a <code>thisArg</code>, and if you don't, <code>this</code>
will be bound to <code>undefined</code> (<a
href="http://es5.github.com/#x15.4.4.18">reference</a>). </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
function f() { console.log(String(this)); }

[1,2].forEach(f); // prints undefined, undefined
[1,2].forEach(f, "mythisarg"); // prints "mythisarg" "mythisarg"
{% endhighlight %}

<h4>Callbacks To DOM Builtins</h4> 

<p>Some callbacks, like <code>setInterval</code> and
<code>setTimeout</code>, pass the global object rather than
<code>undefined</code>.  ECMAScript-defined functions have been
specified to take and explicit this argument or pass undefined, but the
DOM APIs (to my knowledge) still usually pass the global object when
there is no DOM node involved.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
function f() { console.log(this); }

setTimeout(f,0); // prints the global object
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Other callbacks, like those registered on DOM nodes themselves, pass
the node as the <code>this argument</code>.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
document.addEventListener('click', function() { console.log(this); })
// prints the document object when you click on the page
{% endhighlight %}

<p>It's nice to think of this case as the browser doing a method
invocation for you, with the DOM element to the left of the dot.</p>

<h4>At the Toplevel</h4>

<p>
When using this at the toplevel (which is allowed), it is bound to the
global object (even in strict mode, it's just the <a
href="http://es5.github.com/#x10.4.1.1">default global <code>this</code>
binding </a>):
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
console.log(this) // prints the window object
{% endhighlight %}

<h4>Functions Invoked with <code>new</code></h4>

<p>
When you use the <code>new</code> keyword, <code>this</code> is bound to
a newly-created object with its internal <code>proto</code> set to the
<code>prototype</code> field of the constructor.
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
function f() {
  console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(this) === f.prototype);
}
new f(); // prints true
{% endhighlight %}

<h4>Call, Apply, and Bind</h4>

<p>The builtins <code>Function.prototype.call/apply/bind</code> allow
you to provide your own <code>this</code> argument to a function:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
function f() { console.log(String(this)); }
f.call("mythis", "other", "args"); // prints "mythis"
f.apply("mythis", []); // prints "mythis"
f.bind("mythis")(); // prints "mythis"
{% endhighlight %}

<h4>Field Access with Getters and Setters</h4>

<p> If a property is a getter or a setter, <code>this</code> is bound to the
object to the left of the dot or bracket in the field access or
assignment expression. This sort of matches the method invocation rule
except for the fact that "method call" is implicit; there are no () in
the expression o.x, but it may call a getter function for x that passes
o as this (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x8.12.3">reference</a>).  </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
o = { foo: 42,
      bar: "another field",
      get x() { console.log(this.foo); },
      set x(_) { console.log(this.bar); } };
o.x; // prints 42
o.x = "whatever"; // prints "another field"
{% endhighlight %}

<h4>Caveat: Primitive Coercions</h4>

<p> The dot and bracket operators implicitly convert primitives like
numbers, strings, and booleans to objects, so it's not exactly what's to
the left of the dot (this is why I have calls to <code>String</code> in
a few examples to make them print the way I wanted): </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
    Number.prototype.identity = function() { return this; }
    var x = 5
    var x2 = x.identity()
    typeof x2 === 'object' // (true!)
    typeof x2 === 'number' // (false!)
{% endhighlight %}

<p> Again, strict mode gives us saner behavior.  You can get the raw
primitive if you make the function strict: </p>

{% highlight javascript %}
    Number.prototype.identity2 = function() { "use strict"; return this; }
    var x = 5;
    var maybe_five = x.identity2();
    typeof maybe_five === 'object' // (false)
    typeof maybe_five === 'number' // (true)
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>The Next List</h3>

<p>
My next list will probably be a list of ways variables can be bound in
JavaScript, but I'm open to other suggestions.  <a

something else or want to report a bug in this list.</p>
