<h2>Prospective PhD Students</h2>

I'm affiliated with the <a
href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/">ProgSys</a> group at UCSD,
<em>but</em> as a teaching-focused faculty I'm not currently looking to be the
primary advisor of PhD students. You should definitely apply to and come to
UCSD, and we might even do research together!  I'm just not looking for the
dedicated mentor/apprentice relationship right now.

<h2>Current UCSD Students</h2>

<p>Email away and I'll do my best to respond.
If you find yourself spending a lot of time writing or figuring out the tone for you
message, here's some useful advice on communicating (with me) via email:
<a target="_blank" href="http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-email/">How to email</a></li> </p>


<h3>Questions in a Course with Me</h3>

<p>
Use the course web site and course message board (e.g. Piazza, Campuswire),
<b>unless</b> you have an academic accommodation or other specific concern that
cannot be handled by a TA. In that case, please do email me!
</p>

<p>
If you email me a routine question about course content, I will ask you to put
it on the message board. A TA or tutor will likely be able to answer more
quickly than I can, and even if they can't, I'll process the message board
about as quickly as email.
</p>

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>If you're interested in working on Pyret, using it and <a href="https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang/issues">reporting issues</a> is a
great way to contribute.  If you want to really get my attention, tackle one of
the good first issues for <a
href="https://github.com/brownplt/code.pyret.org/labels/Good%20First%20Issue">code.pyret.org</a>
or <a
href="https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang/labels/Good%20First%20Issue">the
language</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a specific idea spurred by coursework or your own research
directions, feel free to email or come by office hours to chat.</p>

<h3>For Prospective Tutors</h3>

I get a lot of tutor applications, and don't always have a chance to interview
everyone who applies. Here's what you should do to help me best evaluate your
application:

<ul>
<li>Put my course as your <em>first or second</em> preference.</li>

<li>Give an example of a short program that convincingly demonstrates how
changes to heap-allocated values are different from variable updates, and
describe it in a few sentences.</li>

<li>Tell me two concrete things you want to <em>improve</em> about the course
experience, from content to presentation to culture to lab hours, in your
essay.</li>

<li>Type the following sentence in your essay, or explain why it's not true: “I
expect to be available for course duties from the first day of the
quarter (which is earlier than the first day of instruction) until grades are
due.”</li>

<li>If there's something on your resume that you want me to pay particular
attention to, mention it in your essay.</li>

<li>My classes are often large. One thing tutors help with is scaling
logistics. If you have experience that taught you to manage logistics,
scheduling, or automation, tell me about it in your essay. </li>

<li>Don't email me the content above – put it in the application. We are lucky
to have a centralized application system that has prompts for the information I
need.</li>
</ul>

Note that only the department makes tutor offers; I merely express my
preferences and I may be competing with other professors for your time! Also
note that you shouldn't be afraid to apply to tutor if you got a B in the
course, nor should you assume that a high letter grade in the course you're
applying for convinces me that you'll be a successful tutor. 


<h3>For Prospective TAs</h3>

You can generally follow the advice for tutors, with some augmentation:

<ul>

<li>The automation and logistics point is especially important for TAs.</li>

<li>Focus on your teaching presentation video. One of the main tasks I often
assign TAs is leading discussion sections, and I care about your ability to
semi-independently prepare and present material.</li>

</ul>

I use the official application system exclusively to make TA decisions; I'll
contact you if I need more information based on your application. Again, note
that the department has the final say in all TA hiring decisions, we merely
list one another as mutual preferences.

<h3>For a Recommendation Letter</h3>

<p>If your <em>only</em> contact with me is through taking an undergraduate
course, and we've never had a conversation longer than a few minutes, I will
likely say “no” to writing you a letter. After writing a lot of these, I've
decided that they're not providing much value, because I can't say anything
that isn't said reasonably well by your transcript. If you just need a short
acknowledgement that you're in my class, I'm happy to do it, but beyond that
I'll usually decline – certainly PhD program letters require that I know more
about you for them to be useful.</p>

<p>If we've worked together outside of classes at all and I can give relevant
comments on your experience, ask away! When you request a letter, include: </p>

<ul>

<li>What kinds of positions you're applying to. If you need the letters for
graduate school, make it abundantly clear what department you are applying to
and if it is for a masters or PhD program.</li>

<li>What the <b>first deadline</b> is (once I've written the letter for one place,
it's usually trivial to send it to others, so the first deadline is what
matters). If this deadline is less than a month away, sometimes I struggle to
to write the letter in time.</li>

<li>List, as a sentence or two each, 3-5 things that you did in your role that
you're proud of.  For example, if you worked on a research project with me,
what were the contributions you felt you really owned and drove to success? If
you were my tutor, did you build a new assignment, or were you a logistics
wizard, or did you really nail Piazza management during a hectic period? If you
took multiple courses with me and did all the optional extensions to
assignments for your own learning, what did you get out of it?</li>

<li>If the program requires you to write a statement of purpose, research
statement, etc, send a draft of that along with your request for a letter.</li>


</ul>

<p>
If the letter is for a PhD program, read this for some perspective on the
letter-writing process from the faculty perspective: <a
href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Grad-School-Recos/">https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Grad-School-Recos/</a>.
Practice concise writing, and <b>don't</b> write an entire
draft of a letter. Your writeup of the above items shouldn't take up
more space than the instructions themselves do.
</p>
