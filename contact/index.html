<p>
You might have lots of reasons to contact me. Awesome! Let's chat.
</p>


<p>I communicate mostly through email. If you need to call me, please try to
send email first to set it up. I may or may not pick up phone calls from
unknown numbers unless I'm expecting it.</p>

<p>For general research and professional inquiries, email away. I have advice
for a few specific categories of communication below.</p>

<blockquote>

<h2>Prospective PhD Students</h2>

I'm not currently looking to be the primary advisor of PhD students. You should
definitely apply to and come to UCSD, and we might even do research together!
I'm just not looking for the dedicated mentor/apprentice relationship right
now.

<h2>Current UCSD Students</h2>

<p>If you're a newer student, you might not have a lot of practice with writing
professional email. (I may have even linked you to this page as advice for
shaping your message). That's fine!  Email away and I'll do my best to respond.
However, I get lots of mail so it helps a lot to get focused, concise messages. Here's some
useful advice on communicating via email: <ul> <li><a target="_blank"

<h3>Questions in a Course with Me</h3>

<p>
Use the course web site and course message board (e.g. Piazza), <b>unless</b>
you have an academic accommodation or other specific concern that cannot be
handled by a TA. In that case, please do email me!
</p>

<p>
If you email me a routine question about course content, I will ask you to put
it on the message board. A TA or tutor will likely be able to answer more
quickly than I can, and even if they can't, I'll process the message board
about as quickly as email.
</p>

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>If you're interested in working on Pyret, using it and <a href="https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang/issues">reporting issues</a> is a
great way to contribute.  If you want to really get my attention, tackle one of
the good first issues for <a
href="https://github.com/brownplt/code.pyret.org/labels/Good%20First%20Issue">code.pyret.org</a>
or <a
href="https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang/labels/Good%20First%20Issue">the
language</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a specific idea spurred by coursework or your own research
directions, feel free to email or come by office hours to chat.</p>

<h3>For Prospective Tutors</h3>

I get a lot of tutor applications, and don't always have a chance to interview
everyone who applies. Here are some tips for maximizing your chances:

<ul>

<li>Don't assume that because you got an A and know the material well, I will
be convinced that you will be a good tutor. Don't assume that because you
got a B, you will not succeed as a tutor.</li>

<li>I typically only read the applications of students who put my course as
their <em>first</em> preference.</li>

<li>My tutors help drive the design and direction of course offerings. Tell me
concrete things you want to <em>improve</em> about the course experience, from
content to presentation to culture to lab hours, in your essay. If you really
want to convince me, go find a writeup of a programming assignment in one of
my past courses and constructively criticize it, indicating how you would make
it clearer to students.</li>

<li>My classes are large. One thing tutors help with is scaling logistics. If
you have experience that taught you to manage logistics, scheduling, or
automation, tell me about it. </li>

</ul>

Feel free to email me the essay and indicate your interest. Sometimes I follow
up on emails for more information, sometimes I see an application and can tell
I want to work with a tutor just from that. Note that only the department makes
tutor offers; I merely express my preferences and I may be competing with other
professors for your time!


<h3>For Prospective TAs</h3>

You can generally follow the advice for tutors, with some augmentation:

<ul>

<li>The automation and logistics point is especially important for TAs.</li>

<li>Focus on your teaching presentation video. One of the main tasks I often
assign TAs is leading discussion sections, and I care about your ability to
semi-independently prepare and present material.</li>

</ul>

I use the official application system exclusively to make TA decisions; I'll
contact you if I need more information based on your application. Again, note
that the department has the final say in all TA hiring decisions, we merely
list one another as mutual preferences.

<h3>For a Recommendation Letter</h3>

<p>If your <em>only</em> contact with me is through taking an undergraduate
course, and we've never had a conversation longer than a few minutes, I will
likely say “no” to writing you a letter. After writing a lot of these, I've
decided that they're not providing much value, because I can't say anything
that isn't said resonably well by your transcript. If you just need a short
acknowledgement that you're in my class, I'm happy to do it, but beyond that
I'll usually decline – certainly graduate school letters require that I know
you outside of class for them to be useful.</p>

<p>If we've worked together outside of classes at all and I can give relevant
comments on your experience, ask away! When you request a letter, include: </p>

<ul>

<li>What kinds of positions you're applying to. If you need the letters for
graduate school, make it abundantly clear what department you are applying to
and if it is for a masters or PhD program.</li>

<li>What the <b>first deadline</b> is (once I've written the letter for one place,
it's usually trivial to send it to others, so the first deadline is what
matters). If this deadline is less than a month away, sometimes I struggle to
to write the letter in time.</li>

<li>List, as a sentence or two each, 3-5 things that you did in your role that
you're proud of.  For example, if you worked on a research project with me,
what were the contributions you felt you really owned and drove to success? If
you were my tutor, did you build a new assignment, or were you a logistics
wizard, or did you really nail Piazza management during a hectic period? This
helps prime my memory for writing the letter.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Practice concise writing. Your writeup of the above items shouldn't take up
more space than the instructions themselves do.
