## Pyret Visual Studio Code Extension

We've released a VScode extension at

[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PyretProgrammingLanguage.pyret-parley](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PyretProgrammingLanguage.pyret-parley)

You can install it by searching in the VScode extensions search as well – it's
called “(Experimental) Interactive Pyret Mode”.

When you install it and open any file with a `.arr` extension, it will load a
window that looks like code.pyret.org's editor. Further, it is a [web
extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/web-extensions),
so you can easily open it from Github repositories. If you have a Github account
and want to follow along, you can visit this repository:
