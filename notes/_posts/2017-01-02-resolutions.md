title: "Resolutions"

Every year I make a New Year's resolution to try and clean up sloppiness in my
speaking and writing.  I can focus on about one of these at a time until it
becomes habit, and a year is a reasonable cadence for me to do so.  Some
examples of past ones:

- Stop accidentally telling people what to do, as in "I do this thing with
  cleaning up my language every year, you should try it!" I find it annoying
  when I am told I "should" do things because it worked in someone else's
  different context. I've tried to replace this with simply saying how things
  are useful to me (a good reflective exercise in its own right).

- I don't know "most programmers" or "most students," and even more so I don't
  know "most people." I also don't know a representative sample of either.  At
  best, I _might_ know "most current Pyret programmers," "most Brown CS
  graduate students," etc.  Invoking the general group, as in "most programmers
  would understand that object access works that way," is specious, and I
  should narrow the context to what I know, or find a more objective argument.
  This one has been really handy for focusing my arguments (especially in
  language design), and for finding what to probe in arguments others make,
  since most people make this mistake.  Or, I should say more specifically, a
  number of folks I correspond with have done this in the past two years :-)

- Don't use hyperbolic words.  I have never been "starving" (though, in the
  words of Louis CK, sometimes I could _really_ use a donut), or actually
  "exhausted," nor do I believe I've ever felt "hate."  Few things are the
  worst or the best in a category (in fact, usually one each).  Hopefully this
  makes me less likely to come across as like literally the worst millenial
  ever.

This year, I'm trying to avoid baldly stating "I don't have time." I'll try to
find a better way to say what I mean. I have a feeling I'll be served well by
saying "no" a lot in my first year as faculty, and I'd like a more specific
reason than scarcity of one vaguely-defined resource. Other answers that help
me and folks who might want to work with me are (nice versions of): "that's not
a priority for me," "I don't have any goals that are served by that outcome,"
"my involvement won't materially affect the outcome," "that will divide my
focus while I need to be teaching," etc.
