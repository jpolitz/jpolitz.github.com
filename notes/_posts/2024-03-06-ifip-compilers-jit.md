<h2><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a></h2>

This page is for resources for the talk “An Incremental Approach to JIT
Construction”.

Abstract: To borrow from/with apologies to <a
href="http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf">Ghuloum</a>: Real-life
JIT (just-in-time) compilers are too complex to serve as an educational tool.
And the gap between real-life JITs and the educational toy compilers is too
wide.  The novice JIT writer stands puzzled facing an impenetrable barrier,
“better write an ahead-of-time compiler instead.”

The goal of my current compiler course design is to break that barrier. I want
to show that building a JIT can be done incrementally and alongside the
infrastructure needed for a traditional AOT compiler. This talk presents one
incremental curricular breakdown of meaningful JIT infrastructure achievable in
a single course.
