<h2><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a></h2>

This page is for resources for the talk “High Standards, Multiple Tries – How I've Been Grading”.

Slides: [pptx](/docs/high-standards-multiple-tries.pptx)

Several course websites that use (variants of) the grading scheme I mentioned:

- [https://ucsd-cse15l-w24.github.io/#grading](https://ucsd-cse15l-w24.github.io/#grading) (This is specifically the instance from the talk)
  - That link goes directly to “Grading”, but overall policies for skill
    demonstrations, lab reports, and some sample skill demos are linked from
    that page
  - Individual week links from the sidebar have lab report descriptions
- [https://ucsd-cse15l-f23.github.io/syllabus/#grading](https://ucsd-cse15l-f23.github.io/syllabus/#grading)
- [https://ucsd-compilers-s23.github.io](https://ucsd-compilers-s23.github.io)

This paper (though not about CSE15L, which was featured in the talk), describes
a “two tries” exam strategy from our accelerated intro course, also in the
spirit of the talk:
