WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:01.200
Joe: Hi everyone.

00:01.260 --> 00:02.410
My name's Joe Politz.

00:02.430 --> 00:06.240
I'm teaching faculty at UC San
Diego in the computer science

00:06.240 --> 00:07.020
and engineering department.

00:07.940 --> 00:10.620
If you're watching this, I'm
expecting that you're an incoming

00:10.620 --> 00:13.800
transfer student this fall into
the computer science department.

00:15.530 --> 00:22.080
And what I want to talk about is some
material I have planned for this summer

00:23.099 --> 00:26.610
to help you prepare a little bit for that.

00:28.300 --> 00:34.975
So I teach a lot of the lower division
programming courses in the department.

00:35.855 --> 00:39.375
And so I'm one of, you
know, many instructors.

00:39.375 --> 00:41.805
We have a lot of great, great instructors
here, but I've taught enough of the

00:41.805 --> 00:45.625
courses that I have a decent handle on
a lot of the material in that sequence.

00:47.175 --> 00:49.275
And so I wanna talk
about that a little bit.

00:50.235 --> 00:52.905
Because you may or may not have
credit for some of those courses.

00:53.275 --> 00:58.350
And this summer might get you up to speed,
review, introduce some content that will

00:58.760 --> 01:00.405
help you with getting started in the fall.

01:01.805 --> 01:07.235
So incoming first year
students or freshmen to UCSD

01:07.455 --> 01:09.555
CSE take one of two courses.

01:09.555 --> 01:15.165
They either take CSE8A
and  then 8B or CSE 11.

01:15.165 --> 01:19.554
So sort of two tracks.

01:19.785 --> 01:23.730
And then CSE 11 and 8B sort of
end at the same place, just a two

01:23.730 --> 01:25.350
course versus a one course sequence.

01:26.010 --> 01:31.800
CSE 11 is a called our
accelerated introduction.

01:33.970 --> 01:40.060
And it is about object oriented
programming and it's taught in Java.

01:40.090 --> 01:52.845
CSE 12 is basic data structures
also taught in Java and then

01:52.850 --> 01:55.310
these feed into other courses
that lead into the upper division.

01:55.670 --> 01:59.655
So CSE 30 is our systems
programming course.

01:59.660 --> 02:03.495
So assembly and C programming
sort of how computers work.

02:04.555 --> 02:09.465
CSE 100 is an advanced data structures
course and sort of after this, a lot

02:09.465 --> 02:10.945
of the upper division courses open up.

02:11.905 --> 02:17.380
And then our math sequence within
the CSE coded courses is CSE 20,

02:17.399 --> 02:21.600
which is discrete math and CSE 21,
which is algorithms and complexity.

02:21.605 --> 02:23.640
And those are requirements for CSE 100.

02:24.570 --> 02:32.230
So one other course CSE15L it's
our lab course and that course is

02:32.230 --> 02:35.630
about some UCSD specific systems.

02:36.450 --> 02:39.000
But also about just
programming systems and.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.625
Some of the tools we use on a day to
day basis in some of the other courses

02:44.195 --> 02:47.955
there's nothing really outside of
UCSD that corresponds to that credit.

02:49.545 --> 02:53.025
So it's unlikely that any of you
have credit for it already, and

02:53.025 --> 02:54.015
I'm teaching that in the fall.

02:54.015 --> 02:59.395
So it's also very likely that you'll
see me teaching that in the fall.

02:59.855 --> 03:03.120
This summer I'm focusing on
stuff from CSE 11 and CSE 12,

03:03.120 --> 03:04.650
cuz it's nicely consolidated.

03:04.650 --> 03:05.670
It's all in Java.

03:05.910 --> 03:08.015
There's some preexisting
material I can share with you.

03:08.515 --> 03:12.340
And it's also the place where
there's sort of the most variety

03:12.340 --> 03:13.620
and who has credit for what.

03:13.980 --> 03:18.570
And also a place where it's nice to talk
about having a solid foundation based

03:18.570 --> 03:21.140
on how we approach those courses here.

03:21.580 --> 03:25.170
So my goals for this
summer are really twofold.

03:25.170 --> 03:27.290
One is provide those resources.

03:28.670 --> 03:31.005
Which are gonna come in two main forms.

03:32.445 --> 03:43.305
So we have a online version of the CSE11
materials and that includes videos and

03:43.305 --> 03:45.525
assignments and an online textbook.

03:45.525 --> 03:48.285
So that link.

03:49.515 --> 03:52.105
Has been provided to you in email.

03:52.105 --> 03:55.875
And so that's something I want you to be
able to see, you can work through this.

03:55.875 --> 03:57.624
It's all, it's all free and open online.

03:58.084 --> 04:01.035
And then be able to ask questions about
it and things like that this summer.

04:01.655 --> 04:07.824
And then also I want to
provide weekly materials, oops,

04:11.384 --> 04:16.695
weekly materials, which include videos
like this one that will actually

04:16.695 --> 04:18.315
be like about a programming topic.

04:21.060 --> 04:29.490
and then a quiz or problem of the week
where you'll actually complete some quiz

04:29.789 --> 04:33.900
questions about a topic or do a small
programming assignment, sort of in the

04:33.900 --> 04:35.489
style of our programming assignments here.

04:35.869 --> 04:38.789
And then we'll have the opportunity
to talk about and go over that.

04:39.210 --> 04:40.680
So those are the kinds of resources.

04:40.740 --> 04:44.520
And then the other thing I want to have
is some time for us to do Q and a, this.

04:45.765 --> 04:49.665
and so there's a discord that
you'll all be invited to join.

04:49.665 --> 04:50.985
So discord is like a chat server.

04:50.985 --> 04:54.045
We can go on and have a user
account and chat with other people.

04:54.535 --> 04:59.865
And so I want to be able to be there so
you can ask content questions, right?

04:59.865 --> 05:04.275
Just like, ask me about Java interfaces
or something you read in the online

05:04.275 --> 05:06.825
textbook or something like that.

05:06.965 --> 05:12.320
Also, you know, like course and advising
questions that you might have for me

05:12.320 --> 05:18.539
that are useful to ask of a faculty
member you can and should ask our

05:18.539 --> 05:20.159
advising staff advising questions.

05:20.159 --> 05:20.940
They're amazing.

05:20.940 --> 05:23.640
And they know a lot more than me,
about a lot of things about our

05:23.640 --> 05:27.630
internal systems but sometimes about
like the interaction of content and

05:27.630 --> 05:28.890
prerequisites and things like that.

05:28.890 --> 05:30.085
I'll have a useful perspective.

05:30.825 --> 05:37.110
And that's also related to talking about
like petitions and incoming credit.

05:37.530 --> 05:41.970
Again, the advising staff know
a lot about this and in many, or

05:41.970 --> 05:43.570
maybe most cases more than I do.

05:44.150 --> 05:46.550
But I also know the content
of our courses really well.

05:46.550 --> 05:50.730
And so I can talk about if
you should ask for credit for

05:50.730 --> 05:53.469
particular courses or if you'd have
a good case and things like that.

05:53.469 --> 05:58.320
So part of my goal this summer is also
just to give you that information and

05:58.320 --> 06:03.000
give you some advice on the way to
sort of start with the most appropriate

06:03.000 --> 06:04.410
credit for whatever your background is.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.420
So those are my goals.

06:07.870 --> 06:14.100
In terms of reaching me I'm gonna be
sending you an email similar to the

06:14.100 --> 06:15.990
one this  video is in every week.

06:17.110 --> 06:23.890
You can email me at jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu.

06:23.940 --> 06:26.970
It's useful to me if you mention
in somewhere in the subject or

06:26.970 --> 06:29.250
early in the email that you're
an incoming transfer student.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.310
So I, I, I know who it's coming from.

06:32.530 --> 06:43.020
And also if you want to chat on zoom,
on my website, I have a contact page,

06:43.140 --> 06:51.900
so that's the URL and I have open
zoom office hours on Tuesdays from

06:51.900 --> 06:53.549
9-10am and  the link is at that page.

06:54.469 --> 06:56.635
There's actually several faculty
that do these open office

06:56.635 --> 06:58.515
hours throughout the year.

06:58.515 --> 07:02.475
And, and some of us do them in the summer
as well for incoming students or existing

07:02.475 --> 07:03.975
students to ask advising questions.

07:03.975 --> 07:06.735
And so that's a time where at least
for me, you can just come find me.

07:06.765 --> 07:10.785
I'm, I'm always available at that
time for you to stop by say hello,

07:10.875 --> 07:12.195
ask questions, things like that.

07:12.855 --> 07:17.055
And then in terms of a like a call to
action for you, for things you can get

07:17.055 --> 07:24.015
started on right now,  I sent along
with this a survey, just to get some

07:24.015 --> 07:26.835
information about what courses you
have credit for, what you're interested

07:26.835 --> 07:31.655
in this summer, what some of your
goals are for the summer coming in.

07:31.695 --> 07:34.575
And I've also per posted
the first activity.

07:34.575 --> 07:42.155
So there's a quiz on Gradescope and
there's an invite code for Gradescope in

07:42.155 --> 07:43.575
the message that this video comes with.

07:44.205 --> 07:47.369
And so you can go do the first quiz.

07:47.830 --> 07:51.699
A note about this quiz is that it's
intended to be somewhat challenging.

07:51.949 --> 07:55.710
You might not have seen the kinds of
questions that are asked in this quiz.

07:55.710 --> 07:58.259
I'm using it in part to
sort of calibrate like.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.320
What people know what people
don't know and things like that.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.700
So there's absolutely no problem.

08:02.700 --> 08:05.700
If you're completely bewildered by
some of the questions in this quiz.

08:06.510 --> 08:10.080
It's great if they make sense to you,
but you know there's a lot of you

08:10.085 --> 08:13.760
and, and all of you have different
background, so don't it it's completely

08:13.960 --> 08:16.349
expected that there's a lot of
questions that, that there's several

08:16.355 --> 08:17.490
questions that could be really hard.

08:18.330 --> 08:25.629
And then of course, if you're interested
in being on there sign up for disc.

08:27.885 --> 08:31.884
Because that's a place where we can
chat and do do Q&A and stuff like that.

08:32.835 --> 08:35.204
So that's what you can do to get started.

08:35.204 --> 08:36.194
That's how you can reach me.

08:36.194 --> 08:38.295
And those are my goals for the summer.

08:38.295 --> 08:42.164
And you should be expecting
weekly emails from me like this.

08:43.335 --> 08:43.664
Thanks.

08:43.664 --> 08:46.585
And looking forward to working with you
with you this summer and in the fall.
